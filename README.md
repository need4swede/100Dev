# 100Dev!
### Full-Stack WebDev Boot Camp
This is my journey of becoming a FS Web Developer in pursuit of becoming a Software Engineer.

At the time of starting this journey, I have played around with some other programming languages (C, PS, Python); but this will be my first effort of mastering a set of principles that (hopefully) will yield me the necessary knowledge to pursue my career goals.

The resources herein shall host my progress, faults and all, and will serve as a reflective tool to not only guide me on my journey forward, but also to remind me of my efforts along the way. Thank you for joining me on this task - I am happy to have you along.
