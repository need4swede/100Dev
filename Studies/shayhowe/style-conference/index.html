                        <p>Every year the <strong>brightest</strong> web designers and front-end developers descend on <em>Chicago</em> 
                            to discuss the latest technologies. Join us this August! Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way 
                            for writers to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the 
                            random paragraph will be about when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three 
                            common writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it. 
                            A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to have 
                            the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, 
                            the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.</p>
